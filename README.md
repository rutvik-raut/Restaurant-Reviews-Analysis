# Restaurant-Reviews-Analysis

Getting to know if a Restaurant is appealing to the people is very important for its success, and customer reviews can help in that context. The only problem with going through it manually is that there is just a lot of data to process for a human being.

Hence for the very purpose created a Restaurant Reviews Analyser using Natural Language Processing. Used the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) to work with human language data.
Used the Bag of Words model, a Gaussian Naive Bayes Classifier and achieved an accuracy of 73%.
